    <h2>Clustering and Server Support</h2>
    <p>Tamara Funk supported both internal and external clients in her 11-year career with nTelos.
        Her operating system work bolstered an integrated voice response (IVR), the system underlying the companyâ€™s
        customer care phone tree. Additionally, Tamara built a cluster that hosted software that linked the IVR and a Wireless Over The Air Service Provisioning platform, allowing handsets to be programmed by inventory and sales by dialing a number on the handset.</p>
