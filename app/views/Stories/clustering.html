    <h2>Clustering and Server Support</h2>
    <p>Tamara Funk supported both internal and external clients in her 11-year career with nTelos Wireless.
        Her operating system work bolstered an integrated voice response (IVR), the OS underlying the companyâ€™s
        customer support phone tree. Additionally, Tamara built a cluster that allows customers to program their
        own phones, and for customer support to provide over-the-air programming services.</p>
