        <h2>Using Open Source Monitoring Application Cacti to Fine-tune Ntelos’ Servers</h2>
        <p> In her own words: Tamara “monitors the heck out of every process or system [she] touches,” especially
        when any sort of failure occurs.</p>

        From server load to potential system outages and security breaches,
        Tamara Funk observes the entire matrix of systems to head off problems. And for nTelos Wireless® Funk
        interwove her meticulous monitoring with infrastructural stability--by insisting that built servers entering
        mid-process be clustered in order to prevent a major system breakdown. With Nagios® monitoring in place
        and one of her characteristic plug-in scripts that she had customized, stakeholders got more than adequate
        visibility through her alert system.</p>
