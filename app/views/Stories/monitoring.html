        <h2>Using Open Source Monitoring Applications Nagios and Cacti To Prevent Outages</h2>
        <p> In her own words: Tamara “monitors the heck out of every process or system [she] touches,” especially
        when any sort of failure occurs.</p>

        From server load to potential system outages and security breaches,
        Tamara Funk observes the entire matrix of systems to head off problems. And for her customers Funk
        interwove her meticulous monitoring with infrastructural stability--by insisting that critical
        servers be clustered in order to prevent a major system breakdowns. With Nagios® monitoring in place
        and custom plug-in scripts, stakeholders got exceptional
        visibility through her alerting system.  Upgrade planning was made easier with Tamara's Cacti scripts and templates that produced graphs that showed server statistics and impact of applications on the hardware.  </p>
